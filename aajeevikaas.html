</h3><h5 font="" color="black" face="mistral" align="center"><b>Every year 80% (over 1 Million/ 10 lakh) of technical students in India are not fortunate
enough to get job placements right after their graduation and further waste almost one
year to get a good relevant job. The delayed influx of these critical human resources
from the academics into the industry causes loss of crucial working hours, in-turn
causing a great loss to the Indian economy.
As IT industry is lucrative and IT being One Big Horizontal in All Verticals, most of the
technical graduates try to get into IT jobs but fail. The reason for this is not just lack of
skills but also Industry exposure and real-life project experience before their
graduation leading to lack of job-readiness and self-confidence.
This is for a social cause to eradicate perpetual unemployability issue created due to
lack of Industry Exposure & Experience, and Job-Readiness amongst the freshers
from technical degree/ diploma courses, Cloud Counselage has initiated Cloud
Counselage Professional Community (CCPC) program to provide 360-degree
professional development for the students through Industry & Corporate Exposure,
Career Guidance, Work Experience, etc.
This is for helping millions of students for free, to get them job/ start-up/
business-ready, in time, to save on their struggle time to get a relevant job/ work after
their graduation. In the larger context, this time if utilized productively can add around
$338 Billion to the Indian economy. </b></h5>
